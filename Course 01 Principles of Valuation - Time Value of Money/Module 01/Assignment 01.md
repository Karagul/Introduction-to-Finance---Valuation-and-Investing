Shawn wants to buy a new telescope. He estimates that it will take him one year to save the money and that the telescope will cost $200. At an interest rate of 6%, how much does Shawn need to set aside today to purchase the telescope in one year?  
(Enter just the number in dollars without the $ sign or a comma and round off decimals to the closest integer, i.e., rounding $30.49 down to $30 and rounding $30.50 up to $31.)
