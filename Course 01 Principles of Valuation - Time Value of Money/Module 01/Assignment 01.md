(Enter just the number in dollars without the $ sign or a comma and round off decimals to the closest integer, i.e., rounding $30.49 down to $30 and rounding $30.50 up to $31.)  

### Answer  
`189`  

### Explanation  
PV = (FV / (1 + r) ^ n) = (200 / (1 + 0.06) ^ 1) = (200 / 1.06) = 188.679

Question 04  
-----------  
Jeff has $1,200 that he invests in a safe financial instrument expected to return 4% annually. Marge has $600 and invests in a more risky venture that is expected to return 8% annually. Who has more after 27 years? And how much does he/she have in FV terms?  
* Marge; $52,410.46  
* Marge; $4,792.84
* Jeff; $3,460.04
* Jeff; $56,501.06

### Answer  
* Marge; $4,792.84  

### Explanation  
FV = PV * ((1 + r) ^ n)  
Jeff: FV = $1200 * ((1 + 0.04) ^ 27) = $3460.0423 = $3460.04  
Marge: FV = $600 * ((1 + 0.08) ^ 27) = $4792.8368 = $4792.84  

Question 05  
-----------  
Don has just received a cash gift of $65,000 from his rich eccentric uncle. He wants to set it aside to pay for his daughter Cynthia's college education. Cynthia will begin college in 13 years and Don's financial advisor says that she can earn 8% interest on an investment in a special college fund. How much will Don have in the fund when Cynthia begins college? (Enter just the number in dollars without the $ sign or a comma and round off decimals to the closest integer, i.e., rounding $30.49 down to $30 and rounding $30.50 up to $31.)  

### Answer  
`176776`  

### Explanation  
FV = PV * ((1 + r) ^ n) = $65000 * ((1 + 0.08) ^ 13) = $176775.542 = $176776  

Question 06  
-----------  
Bridgette's grandparents opened a savings account for her and placed $700 in the account. The account pays 3.5% interest. Bridgette wants to be a singer and she has her heart set on a new karaoke machine. The machine costs $200. How much less will the account be worth in 8 years if she buys the karaoke machine now versus leaving the account untouched? (Enter just the number in dollars without the $ sign or a comma and round off decimals to the closest integer, i.e., rounding $30.49 down to $30 and rounding $30.50 up to $31.)  

### Answer  
`263`  

### Explanation  
FV = PV * ((1 + r) ^ n)  
Buys karaoke machine now: FV = $500 * ((1 + 0.035) ^ 8) = $658.40452  
Buys karaoke machine later: FV = $700 * ((1 + 0.035) ^ 8) = $921.766328  
Difference: $921.766328 - $658.40452 = $263.361808 = $263  

Question 07  
-----------  
Joe is getting ready to buy a car. He has $18,000 in investments earning 5.6% annually. The car also costs $18,000. If he doesn't pay cash for the car, Joe can get a loan at 2.7% interest for 6 years. The loan is structured so that Joe pays one balloon payment at the end of 6 years. The balloon payment includes the principal plus all interest accrued over 6 years. If Joe takes the loan will he have enough money available from his investments to make the balloon payment? How much will he be short/have to spare?  
* Yes; $3,840.60  
* No; $3,840.60  
* No; $3,368.04  
* Yes; $3,368.04  

### Answer  
* Yes; $3,840.60  

### Explanation  
FV = PV * ((1 + r) ^ n)  
FV of Car = $18000 * ((1 + 0.027) ^ 6) = $21120.061  
FV of Investment = $18000 * ((1 + 0.056) ^ 6) = $24960.6571  
Thus, Joe would have enough money available from his investments to make the balloon payment.  
Difference: $24960.6571 - $21120.061 = $3840.5961 = $3840.60  

Question 08  
-----------  
Ralph knows that he is going to have to replace his roof soon. If he has the roof replaced now, it will cost $11,000. He could wait 4 years, but it will then cost him $25,000. At what rate will these options cost the same? This is also known as the break-even point. (Allow two decimals in the percentage but do not enter the % sign.)  

### Answer  
`22.79`  

### Explanation  
(FV / PV) = ((1 + r) ^ n)  
=> ($25000 / $11000) = ((1 + r) ^ 4)  
=> 2.27272727 = ((1 + r) ^ 4)  
=> 1 + r = 1.22782601  
=> r = 0.2278601  
=> r = 0.2279 = 22.79%  

Question 09  
-----------  
Jessica is in the market for a new car. She has narrowed her search down to 2 models. Model A costs $27,000 and Model B costs $18,000. With both cars she plans to pay cash and own them for 3 years before trading in for a new car. Her research indicates that the trade in value for Model A after 3 years is 52% of the initial purchase price, while the trade in value for Model B is 33%. Jessica has no emotional attachment to either model and wants to make a strictly financial decision. The interest rate is 7%. For simplicity assume that operating and maintenance costs for the models are identical every year. Which model is the better decision and how much "cheaper" is it than the alternative?  
* Model B; $9,000.00  
* Model A; $9,000.00  
* Model A; $2,387.99  
* Model B; $2,387.99  

### Answer  
* Model B; $2,387.99  

### Explanation  
Model A:  
After 3 years sell for $14040($27000 * 0.52),  
i.e., Net Cost of Model A = $27000 - $14040 = $12960  
Model B:  
After 3 years sell for $5940($18000 * 0.33),  
Cost of Model B = $18000 - $5940 = $12060  
Also, Jessica made $2025.387(($9000 * ((1 + 0.07) ^ 3)) - $9000) on remaining $9000, she didn't spend.  
Net Cost of Model B = $12060 - $2025.387 = $10034.613  
Model B is cheaper than Model A by $2925.387($12960 - $10034.613)  

Question 10  
-----------  
College tuition has been rising at a rate of 6% per year. Currently the average tuition of a state college is $9,500 per year. Andrea's son Trevor will begin college in 13 years. Andrea's portfolio is making 3% annually. How much does Andrea need to have set aside today/now to pay for 4 years of college for Trevor? (Note: Tuition will continue to change annually and Andrea's portfolio balance will continue to accrue interest while Trevor is in school. Also, tuition is due at the beginning of each year.)  
* $38,000.00  
* $57,650.44  
* $57,109.38  
* $55,971.30  

### Answer  
* $57,650.44  

### Explanation  
College fees of First Year  = $20262.8185($9500 * ((1 + 0.06) ^ 13))  
College fees of Second Year = $21478.5876($9500 * ((1 + 0.06) ^ 14))  
College fees of Third Year  = $22767.3028($9500 * ((1 + 0.06) ^ 15))  
College fees of Fourth Year = $24133.3410($9500 * ((1 + 0.06) ^ 16))  
Amount after 16th Year should be = $24133.3410  
Amount after 15th Year should be = $46197.7312($22767.3028 + ($24133.3410 / ((1 + 0.03) ^ 1)))  
Amount after 14th Year should be = $66330.7538($21478.5876 + ($46197.7312 / ((1 + 0.03) ^ 1)))  
Amount after 13th Year should be = $84661.6086($20262.8185 + ($66330.7538 / ((1 + 0.03) ^ 1)))  
Amount at start should be = $57650.4358($84661.6086 / ((1 + 0.03) ^ 13))
