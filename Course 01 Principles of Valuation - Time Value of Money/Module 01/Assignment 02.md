(Enter just the number in dollars without the $ sign or a comma and round off decimals to the closest integer, i.e., rounding $30.49 down to $30 and rounding $30.50 up to $31.)  

### Answer  
`189`  

### Explanation  
PV = (FV / (1 + r) ^ n) = (200 / (1 + 0.06) ^ 1) = (200 / 1.06) = 188.679

Question 04  
-----------  
Jeff has $1,400 that he invests in a safe financial instrument expected to return 3% annually. Marge has $700 and invests in a more risky venture that is expected to return 8% annually. Who has more after 29 years? And how much does he/she have in FV terms?  
* Jeff; $3,299.19  
* Marge; $6,522.09
* Jeff; $63,306.39
* Marge; $72,776.16

### Answer  
* Marge; $6,522.09  

### Explanation  
FV = PV * ((1 + r) ^ n)  
Jeff: FV = $1400 * ((1 + 0.03) ^ 29) = $3299.19171 = $3299.19  
Marge: FV = $700 * ((1 + 0.08) ^ 29) = $6522.09243 = $6522.09  

Question 05  
-----------  
Don has just received a cash gift of $65,000 from his rich eccentric uncle. He wants to set it aside to pay for his daughter Cynthia's college education.

(Enter just the number in dollars without the $ sign or a comma and round off decimals to the closest integer, i.e., rounding $30.49 down to $30 and rounding $30.50 up to $31.)  

### Answer  
`176776`  

### Explanation  
FV = PV * ((1 + r) ^ n) = $65000 * ((1 + 0.08) ^ 13) = $176775.542 = $176776  

Question 06  
-----------  
Bridgette's grandparents opened a savings account for her and placed $500 in the account. The account pays 3.0% interest. Bridgette wants to be a singer and she has her heart set on a new karaoke machine. The machine costs $150. How much less will the account be worth in 9 years if she buys the karaoke machine now versus leaving the account untouched? (Enter just the number in dollars without the $ sign or a comma and round off decimals to the closest integer, i.e., rounding $30.49 down to $30 and rounding $30.50 up to $31.)  

### Answer  
`186`  

### Explanation  
FV = PV * ((1 + r) ^ n)  
Buys karaoke machine now: FV = $350 * ((1 + 0.03) ^ 9) = $456.670613  
Buys karaoke machine later: FV = $500 * ((1 + 0.03) ^ 9) = $652.38659  
Difference: $652.38659 - $456.670613 = $185.715977 = $186  

Question 07  
-----------  
Joe is getting ready to buy a car. He has $18,000 in investments earning 5.6% annually. The car also costs $18,000. If he doesn't pay cash for the car, Joe can get a loan at 2.7% interest for 6 years. The loan is structured so that Joe pays one balloon payment at the end of 6 years. The balloon payment includes the principal plus all interest accrued over 6 years. If Joe takes the loan will he have enough money available from his investments to make the balloon payment? How much will he be short/have to spare?  
* Yes; $3,840.60  
* No; $3,840.60  
* No; $3,368.04  
* Yes; $3,368.04  

### Answer  
* Yes; $3,840.60  

### Explanation  
FV = PV * ((1 + r) ^ n)  
FV of Car = $18000 * ((1 + 0.027) ^ 6) = $21120.061  
FV of Investment = $18000 * ((1 + 0.056) ^ 6) = $24960.6571  
Thus, Joe would have enough money available from his investments to make the balloon payment.  
Difference: $24960.6571 - $21120.061 = $3840.5961 = $3840.60  

Question 08  
-----------  
Ralph knows that he is going to have to replace his roof soon. If he has the roof replaced now, it will cost $11,000. He could wait 4 years, but it will then cost him $25,000. At what rate will these options cost the same? This is also known as the break-even point. (Allow two decimals in the percentage but do not enter the % sign.)  

### Answer  
`22.79`  

### Explanation  
(FV / PV) = ((1 + r) ^ n)  
=> ($25000 / $11000) = ((1 + r) ^ 4)  
=> 2.27272727 = ((1 + r) ^ 4)  
=> 1 + r = 1.22782601  
=> r = 0.2278601  
=> r = 0.2279 = 22.79%  

Question 09  
-----------  
Jessica is in the market for a new car. She has narrowed her search down to 2 models. Model A costs $28,000 and Model B costs $17,000. With both cars she plans to pay cash and own them for 4 years before trading in for a new car. Her research indicates that the trade in value for Model A after 4 years is 59% of the initial purchase price, while the trade in value for Model B is 31%. Jessica has no emotional attachment to either model and wants to make a strictly financial decision. The interest rate is 4%. For simplicity assume that operating and maintenance costs for the models are identical every year. Which model is the better decision and how much "cheaper" is it than the alternative?  
* Model B; $11,000.00  
* Model A; $1,383.45  
* Model A; $11,000.00  
* Model B; $1,383.45  

### Answer  
* Model B; $1,383.45  

### Explanation  
Model A:  
After 4 years sell for $16520($28000 * 0.59),  
i.e., Net Cost of Model A = $28000 - $16520 = $11480  
Model B:  
After 4 years sell for $5270($17000 * 0.31),  
Cost of Model B = $17000 - $5270 = $11730  
Also, Jessica made $1868.4442(($11000 * ((1 + 0.04) ^ 4)) - $11000) on remaining $11000, she didn't spend.  
Net Cost of Model B = $11730 - $1868.4442 = $9861.5558  
Model B is cheaper than Model A by $1618.4442($11480 - $9861.5558)  

Question 10  
-----------  
College tuition has been rising at a rate of 6% per year. Currently the average tuition of a state college is $9,500 per year. Andrea's son Trevor will begin college in 13 years. Andrea's portfolio is making 3% annually. How much does Andrea need to have set aside today/now to pay for 4 years of college for Trevor? (Note: Tuition will continue to change annually and Andrea's portfolio balance will continue to accrue interest while Trevor is in school. Also, tuition is due at the beginning of each year.)  
* $38,000.00  
* $57,650.44  
* $57,109.38  
* $55,971.30  

### Answer  
* $57,650.44  

### Explanation  
College fees of First Year  = $20262.8185($9500 * ((1 + 0.06) ^ 13))  
College fees of Second Year = $21478.5876($9500 * ((1 + 0.06) ^ 14))  
College fees of Third Year  = $22767.3028($9500 * ((1 + 0.06) ^ 15))  
College fees of Fourth Year = $24133.3410($9500 * ((1 + 0.06) ^ 16))  
Amount after 16th Year should be = $24133.3410  
Amount after 15th Year should be = $46197.7312($22767.3028 + ($24133.3410 / ((1 + 0.03) ^ 1)))  
Amount after 14th Year should be = $66330.7538($21478.5876 + ($46197.7312 / ((1 + 0.03) ^ 1)))  
Amount after 13th Year should be = $84661.6086($20262.8185 + ($66330.7538 / ((1 + 0.03) ^ 1)))  
Amount at start should be = $57650.4358($84661.6086 / ((1 + 0.03) ^ 13))
